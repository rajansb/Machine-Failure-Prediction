# Machine-Failure-Prediction-using-SMOTE-oversampling-Random-Subsampling-techniques
In this Novel Project, I am trying to predict Machine Failures. In manufacturing industry, heavy machineries are used. These Machines can undergo failures. The operation of a machine breakdown/Failures occurs when there is a sudden and unexpected performance decline of a machine. As failure frequency is very less, it gives birth to problem of IMBALANCED Dataset, which needs special pre-processing before applications of Machine Learning Algorithms ! It causes a huge loss to the industry. We will use different methods such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree classifier, Support Vector Classifier. We will also try to use Neural Network and decide the optimal method, based on assessment of efficiency of classifier algorithm using matrices like accuracy, recall, precision etc.
